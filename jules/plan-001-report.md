# Task Report: Test Coverage for game/algorithm.go

## Task Summary

The goal of this task was to add test cases for the functions in `game/algorithm.go` to achieve a test coverage of over 80%. The new tests were to be written in a new file, `game/algorithm_jules_test.go`, and the functions `checkLineRL` and `checkLine` were to be ignored.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Code Exploration**: I started by exploring the codebase to understand the data structures and functions in `game/algorithm.go`. I read the definitions of `GameScene`, `PayTables`, `Result`, and `LineData` to understand how they are used in the game logic.

2.  **Test File Creation**: I created a new test file `game/algorithm_jules_test.go` to house the new test cases.

3.  **Test Case Implementation**: I wrote a comprehensive suite of test cases for the following families of functions:
    *   `CalcScatter`
    *   `CalcLine`
    *   `CalcFullLine`

    I also added tests for other utility functions in `algorithm.go` to ensure complete coverage. The tests covered a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and different input values, to ensure the robustness of the functions.

4.  **Coverage Analysis and Improvement**: After writing the initial set of tests, I ran the Go test coverage tool to analyze the test coverage of `algorithm.go`. The initial coverage was below the 80% target. I analyzed the coverage report to identify the functions with low coverage and added more specific test cases to improve it. This process was repeated until the coverage target was met for all required functions.

## Final Test Coverage

The final test coverage for `game/algorithm.go`, excluding the ignored functions, is well above the 80% target. The detailed coverage report for each function is as follows:
