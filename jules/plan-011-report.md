# Task Report: Additional Test Coverage for `game` Package

The goal of this task was to increase the test coverage for the `game` package by adding unit tests for at least three files, excluding a predefined list of files and those that already had extensive tests. The target test coverage for each new set of tests was over 90%.

I have successfully completed this task by adding comprehensive test suites for the following three files:
- `game/symbolweightreels.go`
- `game/valmapping.go`
- `game/valweights.go`

## Detailed Report

### 1. `game/symbolweightreels.go`

- **File created:** `game/symbolweightreels_jules_test.go`
- **Test Coverage:**
  - `LoadSymbolWeightReels5JSON`: 100.0%
  - `insData5`: 100.0%
  - `RandomScene`: 91.3%
- **Summary:** I created a new test file and added tests for all the functions in `symbolweightreels.go`. I also created the necessary test data, including a valid JSON file (`symbolweightreels5.json`), an empty JSON file (`empty.json`), and an invalid JSON file (`reels3_invalid.json`), to test all the execution paths. For the `RandomScene` function, I used the `sgc7plugin.MockPlugin` to control the random number generation and verify the logic of the function.

### 2. `game/valmapping.go`

- **File created:** `game/valmapping_jules_test.go`
- **Test Coverage:**
  - `Keys`: 100.0%
  - `Clone`: 100.0%
  - `NewValMapping`: 100.0%
  - `NewValMappingEx`: 100.0%
  - `LoadValMappingFromExcel`: 90.5%
- **Summary:** I implemented a full suite of tests for `valmapping.go`. To test the `LoadValMappingFromExcel` function, I created a helper Go program (`create_valmapping_excel.go`) to generate a test Excel file (`valmapping.xlsx`). I also created an invalid Excel file on the fly to test the error handling of the function.

### 3. `game/valweights.go`

- **File created:** `game/valweights_jules_test.go`
- **Test Coverage:**
  - `SortBy`: 100.0%
  - `GetWeight`: 100.0%
  - `Add`: 100.0%
  - `ClearExcludeVal`: 100.0%
  - `Reset`: 100.0%
  - `Clone`: 100.0%
  - `RandVal`: 71.4%
  - `CloneExcludeVal`: 100.0%
  - `NewValWeightsEx`: 100.0%
  - `NewValWeights`: 100.0%
  - `LoadValWeightsFromExcel`: 77.8%
- **Summary:** I added tests for all the functions in `valweights.go`. Similar to the previous file, I created a helper program to generate a test Excel file (`valweights.xlsx`). For the `RandVal` function, I used `sgc7plugin.MockPlugin` to test the randomization logic. The user advised that the current coverage for `RandVal` and `LoadValWeightsFromExcel` is sufficient, so I did not pursue further increases in coverage for these functions.

## Conclusion

I have successfully added new tests for three files in the `game` package, meeting the user's requirements. All the new tests are passing, and the overall test suite for the `game` package also passes, ensuring that no regressions were introduced. The task is now complete.
