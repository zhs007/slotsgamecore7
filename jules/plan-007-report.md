# Plan 007 Report

## Task

The task was to add test cases for the `game` directory in the `slotsgamecore7` repository. A specific list of files was to be excluded, and I was asked to choose up to three new files to add tests for, ensuring not to duplicate existing `_jules_test.go` files. The new test files should be named `[filename]_jules_test.go`.

## Work Summary

I analyzed the `game` directory, compared the files with the exclusion list and existing tests, and chose the following three files to work on:

1.  `floatval.go`
2.  `fastreelsrandomsp.go`
3.  `config.go`

For each of these files, I created a corresponding `[filename]_jules_test.go` file and implemented a suite of tests.

### 1. `floatval.go`

- **File created:** `game/floatval_jules_test.go`
- **Tests added:**
    - I created two main test functions, `Test_FloatVal_Float32` and `Test_FloatVal_Float64`, to cover both generic instantiations of the `FloatVal[T]` type.
    - For each type, I tested:
        - The constructors `NewFloatVal` and `NewFloatValEx`.
        - Type and value comparisons using `Type()` and `IsSame()`.
        - String parsing, including valid and invalid inputs, with `ParseString()`.
        - All type conversion functions (`Int32`, `Int64`, `Int`, `Float32`, `Float64`, `String`).
        - All array conversion functions (`Int32Arr`, `Int64Arr`, etc.).
        - The `GetInt()` accessor method.

### 2. `fastreelsrandomsp.go`

- **File created:** `game/fastreelsrandomsp_jules_test.go`
- **Tests added:**
    - `Test_FastReelsRandomSP_New`: This test verifies the `NewFastReelsRandomSP` constructor. It involves creating a sample `ReelsData` object and a test implementation of the `FuncOnSelectReelIndex` callback to ensure the internal `ArrIndex` is built correctly.
    - `Test_FastReelsRandomSP_Random`: This test covers the `Random` method. It uses the `sgc7plugin.MockPlugin` to provide a predictable sequence of "random" numbers. The test verifies that the `Random` method correctly uses the plugin's output (including the modulo logic) to select the expected indices from the `ArrIndex`.

### 3. `config.go`

- **File created:** `game/config_jules_test.go`
- **Tests added:**
    - `Test_Config_NewConfig`: A simple test to ensure the `NewConfig` constructor initializes the internal maps correctly.
    - `Test_Config_SetDefaultSceneString` & `Test_Config_AddDefaultSceneString2`: These tests check the functions that parse scene data from a JSON string. They cover valid input, invalid JSON, and JSON with an incorrect data structure. A bug was found and fixed in the test assertions for scene dimensions (width vs. height).
    - `Test_Config_LoadErrors`: This test verifies that the various `Load...` functions (`LoadLine`, `LoadPayTables`, `LoadReels`) correctly return the `ErrInvalidReels` error when supplied with an unsupported `reels` parameter, testing their dispatch logic.

## Verification

After creating each test file and after fixing the bug in `config_jules_test.go`, I ran the entire test suite for the `game` package using `go test -v ./game/...`. All existing and newly added tests passed successfully, confirming that the new code is correct and has not introduced any regressions.
