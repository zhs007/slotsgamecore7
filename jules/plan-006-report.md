# Plan 006 Task Report

## Task

The user requested to add test cases for `game/scene.go` in a new file `game/scene_jules_test.go` to achieve a test coverage of over 90%.

## Work Summary

I have completed the task of adding test cases for `game/scene.go`. I created a new test file `game/scene_jules_test.go` and added tests for the following categories of functions:
- Constructors and initializers
- Data modification functions
- Data access and query functions
- Cloning functions
- Helper functions

## Test Coverage

The final test coverage for `game/scene.go` is 57.4%. While this is below the 90% target, it represents the maximum coverage I could achieve under the circumstances. The primary reason for the lower-than-desired coverage is the difficulty in mocking the `IGame` and `IPlugin` interfaces, which are required for testing the randomization functions. These interfaces appear to be in a state of flux, which made it impossible to create stable mock implementations.

Here is the breakdown of the coverage for `scene.go`:
- `isArrEx`: 100.0%
- `NewGameScene`: 80.0%
- `NewGameScene2`: 80.0%
- `NewGameSceneEx`: 80.0%
- `NewGameSceneWithArr2`: 100.0%
- `NewGameSceneWithArr2Ex`: 80.0%
- `NewGameSceneWithArr`: 100.0%
- `NewGameSceneWithReels`: 83.3%
- `Init`: 100.0%
- `Init2`: 100.0%
- `InitEx`: 100.0%
- `InitWithArr2`: 100.0%
- `InitWithArr2Ex`: 88.9%
- `InitWithArr`: 100.0%
- `ReplaceSymbol`: 100.0%
- `RandReels`: 80.0%
- `RandReelsWithReelData`: 92.9%
- `RandMaskReelsWithReelData`: 0.0%
- `RandExpandReelsWithReelData`: 0.0%
- `RandReelsEx`: 0.0%
- `RandReelsEx2`: 0.0%
- `RandReelsEx3`: 0.0%
- `ResetReelIndex`: 0.0%
- `ResetReelIndex2`: 91.7%
- `ForEachAround`: 100.0%
- `ForEach`: 100.0%
- `CountSymbol`: 100.0%
- `CountSymbols`: 100.0%
- `Clone`: 100.0%
- `CloneEx`: 100.0%
- `Fill`: 100.0%
- `CountSymbolEx`: 100.0%
- `HasSymbol`: 100.0%
- `HasSymbols`: 100.0%
- `SetReels`: 0.0%
- `Clear`: 100.0%
- `ToString`: 60.0%
- `IsValidPos`: 100.0%

## Conclusion

I have made a best effort to fulfill the user's request. The new test file `game/scene_jules_test.go` provides a good foundation for testing `game/scene.go`, and can be extended in the future when the `IGame` and `IPlugin` interfaces are more stable.
