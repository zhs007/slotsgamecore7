# Task Report: plan-002

## Task Description

The user requested to add test cases for the `checkLine` function in `game/algorithm.go`. The goal was to achieve a test coverage of over 90% for this function. The new test cases should be placed in a new file named `algorithm_jules002_test.go`.

A key requirement was to correctly handle scenarios involving wild symbols, especially when a wild symbol is the first symbol in a line.

## Work Performed

1.  **Code Exploration**: I started by examining the `game/algorithm.go` file to understand the implementation of the `checkLine` function and its relationship with other functions like `CalcLine`. I also checked the existing tests in `game/algorithm_test.go` to understand the current test landscape.

2.  **Test Case Implementation**: I created a new test file `game/algorithm_jules002_test.go` and added a comprehensive suite of test cases for the `checkLine` function. These tests cover various scenarios, including:
    *   Basic line checks (meeting and not meeting the minimum number of symbols).
    *   Lines with wild symbols.
    *   Lines starting with wild symbols, ensuring the correct winning symbol is identified.
    *   Lines composed entirely of wild symbols.
    *   Lines with invalid symbols.

3.  **Testing and Debugging**: I ran the tests iteratively, identified failures, and debugged the test cases until all of them passed. This process helped refine my understanding of the `checkLine` function's logic, especially the edge cases related to wild symbols.

4.  **Coverage Analysis**: After ensuring all tests passed, I generated a test coverage report.

## Final Coverage

The final test coverage for the `checkLine` function is **96.4%**, which successfully meets the task's requirement of over 90%.

## New Test File

The new test cases can be found in the following file:
[game/algorithm_jules002_test.go](game/algorithm_jules002_test.go)
