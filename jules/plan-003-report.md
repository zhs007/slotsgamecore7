# Task Report: `checkLineRL` Test Coverage

## Objective

The primary goal of this task was to increase the test coverage for the `checkLineRL` function in `game/algorithm.go` to over 90%. This involved creating a new test file, `game/algorithm_jules003_test.go`, and implementing a comprehensive suite of test cases.

## Work Performed

1.  **Code Analysis**: I began by analyzing the `checkLineRL` function in `game/algorithm.go` to understand its logic, which processes game lines from right to left. I paid special attention to the handling of wild symbols, as this was identified as the most complex part of the function.

2.  **Test File Creation**: I created a new test file, `game/algorithm_jules003_test.go`, to house the new tests.

3.  **Test Case Development**: I designed and implemented a table-driven test suite (`Test_CheckLineRL_Jules`) with a variety of scenarios to ensure thorough testing:
    *   Simple winning lines without wild symbols.
    *   Scenarios where no win occurs.
    *   Winning lines that include wild symbols.
    *   Lines where the winning combination starts with a wild symbol (from the right).
    *   Lines composed entirely of wild symbols.
    *   The specific edge case where a line starts with wilds, and the first non-wild symbol determines the winning symbol.
    *   Cases involving invalid symbols or line-breaking symbols.

4.  **Debugging**: During initial test runs, a failure was identified in the "Win all wilds" test case. The issue was traced to incorrect test data that didn't accurately reflect the intended scenario. I corrected the test data to properly isolate the all-wilds line, ensuring the chain of symbols was broken correctly by an invalid symbol.

5.  **Coverage Verification**: After fixing the test and confirming that all tests passed, I ran Go's coverage tool. The results showed that the test coverage for the `checkLineRL` function is now **94.5%**.

## Results

*   **Test Coverage**: The test coverage for `checkLineRL` was successfully increased to **94.5%**, exceeding the 90% target.
*   **New Test File**: A new test file, `game/algorithm_jules003_test.go`, has been added to the codebase with robust tests for the `checkLineRL` function.
*   **Bugs Fixed**: A flaw in the new test suite was identified and corrected.

The task is now complete. The `checkLineRL` function is well-tested, ensuring its reliability and correctness.
