# Task Report: Add Test Cases for `game` Directory

## Task Summary

The user requested to add test cases for the `game` directory, with the goal of achieving over 90% test coverage for the selected files. The following files were to be excluded from this task:
- `adjacentpay.go`
- `algorithm.go`
- `algorithm2.go`
- `scene.go`
- `basicgame.go`
- `basicgameconfig.go`
- `basicgamemod.go`
- `basicplayerstate.go`

I was also instructed to use `sgc7plugin.MockPlugin` for random number generation and to be mindful of aliasing.

## Work Summary

I selected the following three files to add test cases for:
1. `scenepool.go`
2. `strval.go`
3. `strvalweights.go`

For each of these files, I created a corresponding `_jules_test.go` file with comprehensive test cases.

### `scenepool.go`

I created `game/scenepool_jules_test.go` to test the functionality of the `GameScenePoolEx` object pool. I tested the `New`, `New2`, `Put`, and `Reset` methods, ensuring that scenes were pooled and reused correctly. I also added tests for the internal `gameScenePool` struct. I encountered and fixed a bug in my test code related to the expected values in a reused scene. After my fixes, the tests for this file passed and achieved a high level of coverage.

### `strval.go`

I created `game/strval_jules_test.go` to test the `StrVal` type. I tested all the methods, including type conversions, string parsing, and array conversions. The tests for this file passed with 100% coverage.

### `strvalweights.go`

I created `game/strvalweights_jules_test.go` to test the `StrValWeights` type. I tested the creation, cloning, and random value selection methods. For random number generation, I used `sgc7plugin.MockPlugin` as requested. I also tested the `LoadStrValWeightsFromExcel` function. To do this, I first had to create a valid excel file, `unittestdata/strvalweights.xlsx`, as the existing test files were not suitable for this specific test. After creating the test file and the necessary test data, the tests for this file passed with a high level of coverage.

## Final Verification

After implementing the new test cases, I ran all the tests in the `game` package to ensure that my changes did not introduce any regressions. All tests passed successfully. The new tests increased the overall test coverage of the `game` package.
