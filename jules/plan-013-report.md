# Task Report: plan-013

## Summary

In this task, I was asked to add test cases for files in the `game` directory, with the goal of achieving over 90% test coverage for the selected files.

After analyzing the directory and excluding files as requested, I identified `game/valmapping2.go` as the primary candidate for new tests.

## Work Done

1.  **File Analysis**: I listed all `.go` files in the `game` directory, filtered out the excluded files and those that already had comprehensive tests written by "jules". `valmapping2.go` was the only remaining file with significant logic that was not fully tested.

2.  **Test Implementation**: I created a new test file, `game/valmapping2_jules_test.go`, to house the new tests. I implemented test cases for the following functions, which were previously uncovered:
    *   `IsEmpty()`
    *   `Keys()`
    *   `Clone()`
    *   `NewValMapping2()`
    *   `NewValMappingEx2()`

3.  **Enhanced Error Handling Tests**: I enhanced the tests for the `LoadValMapping2FromExcel` function by adding test cases for error conditions:
    *   Loading a non-existent Excel file.
    *   Loading an Excel file with malformed data.

4.  **Coverage Verification**: After implementing the tests, I ran the test suite and verified the code coverage for `game/valmapping2.go`. The final coverage for the file is above 90%, meeting the task's requirement.

    ```
    github.com/zhs007/slotsgamecore7/game/valmapping2.go:15:	IsEmpty					100.0%
    github.com/zhs007/slotsgamecore7/game/valmapping2.go:19:	Keys					100.0%
    github.com/zhs007/slotsgamecore7/game/valmapping2.go:29:	Clone					100.0%
    github.com/zhs007/slotsgamecore7/game/valmapping2.go:41:	NewValMapping2				100.0%
    github.com/zhs007/slotsgamecore7/game/valmapping2.go:62:	NewValMappingEx2			100.0%
    github.com/zhs007/slotsgamecore7/game/valmapping2.go:69:	LoadValMapping2FromExcel		90.9%
    ```

## Conclusion

I have successfully added comprehensive tests for `game/valmapping2.go`, significantly improving its test coverage and ensuring its reliability. All new tests are passing.
